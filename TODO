* Change dolfin.AssembleSystem so that it can replace the BC settings. The
   current scheme does not work in parallel. Requires: (1) Working on
   non-diagonal blocks (similar to DirichletBC::zero,
   DirichletBC::zero_columns); (2) Specifying sign of diagonal entry.

* Missing doc strings.

* Documentation.

* Consider removing the __add__ method on Dolfin matrices that does the matrix
   addition and replacing it with block_add.
