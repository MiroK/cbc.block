"""This demo program shows the use of block preconditioners with Biot's consolidation equations.

The algebraic system to be solved can be written as

  BB^ AA [u p]^T = BB^ [b c]^T,

where AA is a 2x2 block system with a negative-definite (2,2) block D. The
system as a whole is symmetric, with C=B'.

       | A   B |
  AA = |       |,
       | C   D |

and BB^ approximates the inverse of the block operator

       | A   0 |
  BB = |       |,
       | 0   S |

where S=C*A^*B-D is (an approximation of) the pressure Schur complement. This
preconditioner is known as Generalized Jacobi. In this program, we use the
approximation S=C*diag(A)^*B-D for the Schur complement, ML approximations of
the inverses, and the SymmLQ iterative solver (suitable for indefinite
symmetric systems).

As an alternative solver (implemented below, but commented out), we can invert
AA directly using the Schur complement:

      | I    0 |   | A^  0 |   | I   A^*B |
AA^ = |        | x |       | x |          |,
      | C*A^ I |   | 0  -S^|   | 0   I    |

where the inverses are taken as exact. We note that this AA^ is equivalent to a
symmetric Gauss-Seidel block scheme, wherein the D block is replaced by -S.

We use conjugated gradient inner solvers for A^ and S^, preconditioned with the
ML approximations. Since the inverse is in principle exact, we do not need an
outer iterative solver, but nevertheless we use a single iteration of the
Richardson method just for reporting purposes.
