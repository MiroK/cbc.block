"""This demo solves the Stokes equations with block preconditioning.

The original demo is found in demo/undocumented/stokes-taylor-hood/python.

The algebraic system to be solved can be written as

  BB^ AA [sigma u]^T = BB^ [b 0]^T,

where AA is a 2x2 block system with zero in the (2,2) block

       | A   B |
  AA = |       |,
       | C   0 |

and BB^ approximates the inverse of the block operator

       | A   0 |
  BB = |       |.
       | 0   L |
