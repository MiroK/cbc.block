This is a python library for block operations in dolfin.

There is no real documentation yet, but a short introduction is found in
blockdolfin.pdf.  For more details of use, I recommend looking at the demos
(named demo-*.py) and the comments therein.

The code is licensed under the GNU Lesser Public License, found in COPYING,
version 2.1 or later. There are some exceptions (BSD license), noted in the
files in question (found under iterative/).
